            <span class="heading-custom">Khajuraho </span>is one of the world heritage site. There are mant temples in khajuraho. The temples at Khajuraho were built during the Chandella dynasty, which reached its apogee between 950 and 1050.
            <br/> Only about 20 temples remain; they fall into three distinct groups and belong to two different religions â€“ Hinduism and Jainism. They strike a perfect balance between architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Kandariya is decorated with a profusion of sculptures that are among the greatest masterpieces of Indian art.<br/>
            The temples of Khajuraho are known for the harmonious integration of sculptures with their architecture. All surfaces are profusely carved with anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic motifs depicting sacred and secular themes. Sculptures depicting acts of worship, clan and minor deities, and couples in union, all reflect the sacred belief system. Other themes mirror social life through depictions of domestic scenes, teachers and disciples, dancers and musicians, and amorous couples.<br/> The composition and finesse achieved by the master craftsmen give the stone surfaces of the Khajuraho temples a rare vibrancy and sensitivity to the warmth of human emotions.
